			<p> So im still trying to figure out what we should do here, i feel
			as it might be easier to just make the site into a page about already
			exiting teams and clans. We can add some steam groups that people might
			want to join, as well as info on how you should go about making a team/group.
			Let me know if you figure out what we should call this website in regards to 
			us making a banner of some sort; or just in gen so we can write up the 
			basic about me page. </p>
