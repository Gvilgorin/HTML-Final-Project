            <h2>What Teams / Clans play that game as well as groups for the game they picked</h2>
            <p>The table has pro teams in it since I tought of somthing else, but its just as an example. we would switch it up and make it nicer. I'm not to sure about my idea so if you figure out anything you wanted to do with that let me know and I'll most likely be happy with it since i cant figure out if thats good. </p>
